# Graph Representations

Implement a function that converts an adjacency matrix to an adjacency list for
a directed unweighted graph using the template in `code.js`. Test your new
function; I've provided some basic testing code that uses
[jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in `code.test.js`. Now, the test code
does contain the solution, so you can have a look at it if you get stuck, but
try not to peek before attempting to solve it on your own.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the runtime complexity of the conversion that you implemented? Does it
depend on the number of vertices, the number of edges, or both?

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. Add your answer to this markdown file.

## Sources

I was having troule visualizing the input for some reason, so I did peek at the
test code briefly to get a general idea of what the input data would look like,
but I did heed your warning, and only used the peek to get an idea of what the
input data structure would be, then verified my suspicion by making a push to
github where I had my code just print out the input from the test code. With my
suspicion verified, I coded my solution independent of other sources, and the
test code's assistance.

## Plagiarism Notice

I certify that I have listed all sources used to complete this exercise, including the use of any Large Language Models. All of the work is my own, except where stated otherwise. I am aware that plagiarism carries severe penalties and that if plagiarism is suspected, charges may be filed against me without prior notice.

## Bonus

Implement a function to convert an adjacency list to an adjacency matrix and
analyze it as above.
